Steps to Run the project:
1) To see the A star Algorithm with OpenCV Visualisation, use the file by the name 'P3_Final_OpenCV_Visualization.py'.

Note: My origin in the map is on the top left. I have not set a robot starting point in the Visualization code. The user needs to input both start and goal points

2) To run the python and V Rep code, please open V-rep and open the scene 'rrl_map' in my folder. 
   Start the Vrep simulation and only then run the file by the name 'P3_Final_Vrep.py'

Note: I have set the robot start position in this file as the origin in the Vrep scene. (which is [560,510] in my maze) 
Please give the goal position in accordance to the origin at top left of the map.
